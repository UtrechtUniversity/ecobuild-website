        This project aims to develop the largest evidence-based, open-access and
        open-source information platform focusing on ecological benefits of
        design strategies. The platform will link existing building design
        solutions to their measured benefits, represented as ecosystem services
        (ESs), and so empower users to take informed decisions for the
        development of regenerative buildings.

        Project Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        Urban areas face pressing environmental challenges, including
        biodiversity loss, climate change, and unsustainable resource
        consumption. The building sector contributes significantly, accounting
        for 40% of natural resources and over 30% of global energy consumption,
        but also holds transformative potential. When designed with nature-based
        solutions (NbS), buildings can actively regenerate ecosystems by
        delivering ESs such as temperature regulation, air and water
        purification, and enhanced biodiversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite growing interest in sustainable design, empirical data linking
        design strategies to measurable ecological outcomes remain fragmented,
        inaccessible, and geographically limited. Professionals lack a
        centralized, trusted platform to guide ecologically informed decisions.
        This platform addresses this gap by unifying disparate data sources into
        a coherent, science-driven system, linking building and urban design
        strategies to proven ecological outcomes. It will accelerate urban
        sustainability transitions and help meet international targets.

        Platform Improvement and Scaling
      </h2>
      <p>
        Following successful pilots, the platform will expand in scope and
        functionality. New data layers, ESs, and design strategies will be
        added, increasing reach and impact. The project seeks to create a shared
        language between computational, ecological, building, and
        socio-political fields of expertise, supporting ecologically beneficial
        designs while addressing risks and opportunities.
